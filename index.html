        <li>His tweetstorm “How to Get Rich (Without Getting Lucky)” became a modern manifesto for entrepreneurs. It gave a framework for young, ambitious people to understand leverage (code, capital, media) and the value of specific knowledge.

          <li>AngelList jobs board opened the startup world to young talent worldwide, not just founders, connecting ambitious people with high-growth startups.
